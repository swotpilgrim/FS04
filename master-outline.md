## ACT 1: SETUP & RECRUITMENT (Chapters 1-8)

Bex's past in 1967 Haight-Ashbury, her collapse and recruitment by PROJECT MIRROR, mission briefing to infiltrate her ex-boyfriend's radical network, creating cover identity "Willow," and first contact with Marcus's safe house.

### Chapter 1: Summer of Love

1967 Haight-Ashbury flashback. Young Bex Morrison, 21, living in commune with Marcus Webb, "The Professor." They're in love, attending demonstrations, working medical tents, believing revolution will change everything. Marcus teaches her political theory, systemic critique. She's a natural chameleon—shifts between radical meetings, straight society, street culture seamlessly. Golden Gate Park at sunset, talking about building new world. Establishes who Bex was: idealistic, passionate, true believer. Marcus is charismatic leader even then. The dream feels real. Chapter ends with Bex in his arms, believing they'll change the world together.

**Word count: 149**

### Chapter 2: The Crash

1973. Bex, 27, hitting bottom. Haight has collapsed—hard drugs replaced idealism, violence replaced peace, friends are dying. Bex at free clinic after three-day shift helping overdose cases. Exhausted, disillusioned, nowhere to go. Marcus disappeared from her life years ago (she left in 1968, breakdown she never explained). FBI agents approach her: Thomas Garrett and partner. They've been watching—she can become anyone, trusted everywhere, invisible when needed. Offer her PROJECT MIRROR: salary, purpose, training. She's broken, desperate. She accepts. Garrett tells her: "We'll give you a reason to use that gift." She doesn't know he means weaponize it.

**Word count: 118**

### Chapter 3: Breaking and Remaking

1973-1975 training montage. CIA facility outside Sacramento. PROJECT MIRROR program: identity construction, deep-cover techniques, psychological compartmentalization. Training is brutal—pushes operatives to dissociate, lose core self, become new people neurologically. Bex watches other recruits fracture: dissociative disorders, psychiatric casualties, some institutionalized. She survives through strict compartmentalization: builds walls between identities, never lets them bleed. Becomes perfect operative—can be anyone, snap back to Bex cleanly. Instructors warn repeatedly: go too deep and you don't come back. She thinks she's immune. Graduates top of cohort, 1975. Ready for deployment. Handler Garrett proud of her. She trusts him completely.

**Word count: 118**

### Chapter 4: Ghost Assignment

1975, mission briefing. Garrett assigns Bex to infiltrate Marcus Webb's radical network in San Francisco. Intelligence indicates Soviet-backed safe house operation planning bombing of Oakland military recruitment center. Mass casualties expected. Need inside asset to identify target, timeline, Soviet handler. When Garrett shows her Marcus's surveillance photo, Bex freezes. That's her ex-boyfriend from 1967-68, the man who taught her to see the world differently. She reveals their history. Garrett considers pulling her, then decides it's operational advantage: she knows Marcus, can predict him, understands radical culture authentically. Bex protests—this violates everything PROJECT MIRROR taught about emotional distance. Garrett overrules: mission critical, she's best asset. She accepts orders.

**Word count: 125**

### Chapter 5: Becoming Willow

Bex constructs cover identity in FBI safe house. "Willow"—burned-out former radical returning to scene after years away, looking for meaning again. The problem becomes clear: to sell this authentically, she must resurrect who she actually was in 1967. Can't fake the politics because radicals will test her knowledge. Can't fake the culture because they'll sense performance. Must become 1967 Bex: the believer. PROJECT MIRROR trained compartmentalization, but this identity isn't separate—it's her past self. Garrett watches her work, sees the danger, says nothing. Bex changes appearance: lets hair grow, adopts period clothing, sheds operative mannerisms. Practices Willow's voice, backstory, beliefs. The transformation is too easy. She's not building cover—she's remembering.

**Word count: 132**

### Chapter 6: Making Contact

Bex as Willow surfaces in San Francisco radical scene. Reaches out through old mutual contacts still around—aging hippies, burned-out activists. Mentions she's looking for Marcus Webb, heard he's doing important work. Word spreads through underground network. Willow's name reaches Marcus. He's curious—someone asking for him specifically, claims to know the old scene. Could be infiltrator, could be genuine. Sends Sunny to vet Willow. Meeting at café in Haight. Bex/Willow passes test by being authentic—knows the history, speaks the language, shows the scars. Sunny invites her to safe house meeting. Bex reports to Garrett via dead drop: contact established. He responds: maintain cover, identify Soviet handler, extract before raid. Simple orders. Impossible mission.

**Word count: 135**

### Chapter 7: The Victorian

Bex attends first safe house meeting. Haight-Ashbury Victorian—same building she lived in during 1967. Psychological shock of return: same layout, same smell (incense, marijuana, mimeograph ink), same revolutionary posters. Upstairs rooms where she slept with Marcus eight years ago. She's wearing wire, betraying everything this place meant. Meets the collective: Sunny (trusting flower child), Rita Walsh (skeptical, watches Willow carefully), David Park (bomb-maker, quiet and precise). And then Marcus enters. He's aged—31 now, still intense, still charismatic. Looks at Willow with curiosity, no recognition. Bex's training holds: different appearance, mannerisms, voice. But when he speaks about revolution, her 1967 self responds. The boundary is already cracking.

**Word count: 135**

### Chapter 8: Recognition Without Knowing

Meeting continues. Marcus discusses the movement, current actions, political theory. Willow participates—her knowledge is authentic because she lived it. Marcus is drawn to her immediately, feels familiar connection he can't place. Asks about her background. Bex/Willow tells constructed story: was in scene in late 60s, burned out, left for years, ready to commit again. It's 90% true. Marcus talks about his ex-girlfriend who disappeared in 1968, never understood why she left. Bex realizes he's talking about her. The pain in his voice is real. She wants to explain, apologize, reveal herself. Can't. After meeting, Marcus asks Willow to stay involved, come to next session. She agrees. Walking home, Bex realizes the mission's real danger: Marcus is falling for Willow because Willow IS Bex, and she never stopped loving him.

## ACT 2: OPERATION & ESCALATION (Chapters 9-22)

Bex integrates into safe house network, discovers bombing plan and Karl's Soviet handler role, struggles with identity fracture and ideological crisis, gathers intelligence while falling back in love with Marcus, and ultimately goes rogue when Garrett orders extraction.

### Chapter 9: Integration

Bex moves into safe house, living undercover 24/7. Shares meals, attends meetings, helps with operations. Reports to Garrett via dead drops every 48 hours. Gathering intelligence: network structure, members, resources. Karl Brenner is Marcus's lieutenant—older, controlled, watchful. Something off about him. Too professional, too strategic. Bex's training flags him: possible handler. She begins watching Karl while appearing to integrate. Sunny befriends Willow completely—talks about hopes for revolution, damaged past, trust in Marcus. Rita Walsh remains skeptical, asks probing questions about Willow's years away. Bex deflects using truth: she did leave, she was broken, she's back. It works because it's authentic. Living as Willow means living as 1967 Bex. Compartmentalization walls starting to blur.

**Word count: 135**

### Chapter 10: The Plan Revealed

Collective meeting: Marcus reveals bombing plan. Target is Oakland military recruitment center, symbolic strike against war machine. Scheduled for two weeks—anniversary of Kent State shootings. He presents it as precision action against military facility. David Park (bomb-maker) discusses technical details: timer, placement, yield. Bex memorizes everything for Garrett. But she notices Karl adjusting details—mentions "maximum impact," suggests timing for "optimal coverage." Marcus doesn't catch the implications, but Bex does: Karl is engineering mass casualties beyond military target. After meeting, Bex checks maps, realizes recruitment center shares building with civilian offices—Social Security, Veterans Affairs. Women, children, workers. Karl structured this for propaganda, not revolution. She reports to Garrett: bombing confirmed, two-week timeline, suspect Soviet manipulation of target selection.

**Word count: 141**

### Chapter 11: The Lieutenant

Bex focuses surveillance on Karl. Watches him during meetings—he's always adjusting Marcus's plans toward greater violence. Researches his background: claims to be Berkeley sociology grad student studying movements. Cover story is solid but feels constructed. She picks his room lock one night (risky, but necessary). Finds hidden radio equipment, encryption materials, Soviet-manufactured surveillance gear. Photograph shows Karl with KGB officers (she recognizes insignia from training). He's not radical—he's professional intelligence officer embedded in movement. Running Marcus as unwitting asset. She photographs evidence, reports to Garrett. Response via dead drop: confirmed KGB active measures operation, continue gathering intelligence on network scope. Don't expose Karl yet—need complete picture before raid. Bex understands: she's bait in larger counterintelligence operation.

**Word count: 135**

### Chapter 12: Golden Gate Ghosts

Marcus asks Willow to walk with him in Golden Gate Park. Same paths where young Bex and Marcus walked in 1967. He talks about his ex-girlfriend, how she taught him to see beyond theory into human reality, how her disappearance broke something in him. Willow asks what happened. Marcus: "She just left. No explanation, no goodbye. I never understood if I did something wrong or if she just stopped believing." Bex wants to explain: she didn't stop believing, she broke from the violence and drugs, she ran to survive. Can't say it. Instead, Willow says: "Maybe she believed too much and it burned her out." Marcus looks at her, recognition flickering without landing. "You remind me of her sometimes." Psychological torture: comforting him for her own abandonment while preparing to betray him again.

**Word count: 150**

### Chapter 13: Identity Bleeding

Bex reports to Garrett at FBI safe house. He reads her latest intelligence, then studies her. "You're fracturing." She denies it. He shows her own reports—language shifting from operative clinical to emotional investment, referring to "Marcus" not "target," defending radical ideology while reporting it. Textbook identity bleed. Garrett: "You're becoming Willow, which means you're becoming who you were. That's the trap." Orders her to re-establish boundaries, remember she's Bex Morrison, federal operative. She tries. Returns to safe house, sits in basement near bomb materials, repeats training mantras: "I am Bex. Willow is cover. Mission is objective." Doesn't work. When Marcus finds her, asks if she's okay, she responds from 1967 heart: "I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be." Doesn't know if Bex said that or Willow.

**Word count: 150**

### Chapter 14: Reconnaissance

Karl takes core team (Marcus, Bex/Willow, David Park) to Oakland recruitment center for reconnaissance. Daytime, posing as protesters outside building. Karl points out structural details, timing patterns, security gaps—professional tactical assessment disguised as radical planning. Bex observes: he's not theorizing, he's executing military operation. Marcus sees symbolic target, Karl sees casualty count. During surveillance, Bex notices adjacent civilian offices, childcare center in building. Realizes explosion will kill dozens of non-military victims. After reconnaissance, she photographs building, notes Karl's actual targeting choices vs. Marcus's stated intent. Reports to Garrett: confirmed mass-casualty design, Karl manipulating Marcus's revolutionary ideals for Soviet propaganda goals. Garrett's response: excellent intelligence, maintain cover, two-week timeline to gather all network members before raid. She's living with people she'll destroy.

**Word count: 141**

### Chapter 15: The Backup

Late-night meeting: Karl reveals backup plan to inner circle only (Marcus, David, Bex/Willow). If recruitment center bomb is discovered or fails, secondary device at BART station—rush hour, maximum casualties. Marcus hesitates: "That's civilians, workers. That's not our target." Karl: "That's the system's participants. Revolutionary action requires commitment." Uses theory, quotes Fanon, manipulates Marcus's beliefs. Marcus accepts reluctantly—the revolution requires sacrifice. Bex watches Karl work: he's running Marcus like asset, using genuine beliefs as handles. After meeting, she's horrified: two bombs, both designed for mass civilian death, backup ensures casualties regardless. She signals emergency dead drop to Garrett: backup target identified, Karl is definitely KGB, recommend immediate raid before bombing timeline advances. Garrett's response changes everything: negative, continue intelligence gathering, need complete network map.

**Word count: 140**

### Chapter 16: Intimacy and Betrayal

Marcus and Willow grow closer. He confides his doubts about violence, whether revolution justifies bloodshed, if they're becoming what they fight against. Willow (Bex? Both?) listens, understands his conflict, sees the good man Karl is manipulating. They talk until dawn about ideology, morality, cost of commitment. Marcus: "You understand me in ways no one has since..." Trails off. Since Bex, eight years ago. Willow is Bex. He's falling in love with his ex-girlfriend wearing different name. She's falling in love again with man she never stopped loving, who she's preparing to destroy. They almost kiss. She stops it—can't do that while wearing wire, can't betray him that completely. He respects boundary, asks her to stay with movement: "We need people who still question. Keeps us human." She agrees. Thinks: I'm the infiltrator who'll end you.

**Word count: 150**

### Chapter 17: Handler Crisis

Garrett pulls Bex for emergency meeting. Shows her surveillance photos: her and Marcus in park, safe house, late-night conversations. "You're emotionally compromised. Identity fracture is complete. You're not operative anymore—you're radical who reports to me." She denies it, insists she's maintaining cover. He: "You defended their ideology in last report. You called the Vietnam critique 'valid.' You're Willow now, not Bex." She realizes he's right—can't tell which beliefs are cover and which are hers. Garrett orders extraction: "Mission abort. You're pulled. FBI will raid based on current intelligence." Bex refuses: "If I leave now, Marcus becomes terrorist. I can save him from Karl's manipulation." Garrett: "Marcus chose violence. You're protecting him because you love him." She can't deny it. But she won't extract. Garrett: "That's direct order." Bex: "I quit."

**Word count: 150**

### Chapter 18: Going Rogue

Bex cuts contact with Garrett, goes fully deep cover. No more dead drops, no more reports, no handler. She's operating independently now—not to serve FBI, but to save Marcus from Karl and stop bombing. Recognizes this violates every protocol, probably ends her career, might get her killed. Doesn't care. She's convinced she can expose Karl as KGB agent, show Marcus he's been manipulated, stop bombing without destroying the man she loves. Psychological state: completely fractured. Doesn't know if she's Bex protecting asset, Willow protecting Marcus, or 1967 Bex trying to save what the movement could have been. Plans her own operation: gather proof of Karl's Soviet connections, present to Marcus privately, turn him against bombing plan. It's desperate, impossible, maybe delusional. But she's committed. No extraction, no backup, no way out.

**Word count: 145**

### Chapter 19: Gathering Evidence

Bex breaks into Karl's locked basement room while he's out. Searches methodically: finds KGB communication codes, Soviet handler contact protocols, classified intelligence on American radical groups, operational plans showing bombing is part of larger destabilization campaign. Most damning: Karl's notes calculating civilian casualties for "optimal media impact"—children's deaths will play best on news. Cold, clinical, inhuman propaganda math. She photographs everything using safe house camera (risk: if anyone finds photos, cover blown). Also discovers Karl suspects Willow—notes about her questions, background inconsistencies, "possible FBI infiltrator." He's running counterintelligence against her while she runs intelligence against him. Mutual surveillance. She needs to move fast. Hides evidence photos in park dead drop (not FBI—her personal cache). Prepares to expose Karl to Marcus. Timeline: one week until bombing.

**Word count: 143**

### Chapter 20: The Confrontation Setup

Bex plans private meeting with Marcus, away from Karl's oversight. Asks him to meet her at Golden Gate Park location where they used to talk in 1967—Willow knows about it from Marcus's stories. He agrees, curious about her urgency. Meanwhile, Karl is tightening security. He knows something's wrong—Willow asking too many questions, FBI surveillance increasing, operational security compromised. Tells Marcus they need to accelerate timeline: bombing in 48 hours, not one week. Marcus resists: "We're not ready, team needs preparation." Karl: "The moment is now or we lose it." Pushes using ideology and urgency. Marcus reluctantly agrees. Bex overhears, realizes her timeline collapsed. Must expose Karl immediately, convince Marcus to abort in 48 hours, or bombing happens. No more FBI backup (she's rogue), no handler support, just her vs. Karl vs. clock.

**Word count: 147**

### Chapter 21: The Truth Revealed

Golden Gate Park meeting. Marcus arrives, finds Willow agitated. She shows him the evidence: photographs of Karl's Soviet intelligence materials, KGB contacts, casualty calculations, operational plans. "Karl is KGB officer. He's using you. The bombing isn't revolution—it's Soviet propaganda operation designed to kill American civilians for TV coverage." Marcus stunned, refusing to believe. "Karl's been with me for years, loyal, committed..." Bex: "He's handler running you as asset. Look at the evidence." Marcus studies photos, sees undeniable proof. Rage and betrayal building. Then asks the operative question: "How did you get these? Who are you?" Critical moment. Bex makes decision: truth is only way. She tells him: "I'm not Willow. I'm Bex. Rebecca Morrison. Your girlfriend from 1967. FBI sent me to infiltrate. I'm PROJECT MIRROR operative." Total exposure. His face: shock, betrayal, devastation. "Everything was a lie?"

**Word count: 150**

### Chapter 22: Fracture Point

Marcus reeling from dual revelation: Karl is Soviet handler, Willow is Bex. Eight years since she disappeared, she returns as infiltrator to destroy him. He's been manipulated by everyone—Karl weaponizing his beliefs, Bex exploiting their past. Screams at her: "Was anything real? 1967, us, did you ever believe?" Bex: "Everything was real. I loved you then, I love you now. That's why I'm telling you the truth—Karl will make you terrorist, kill innocent people for Soviet propaganda. You're better than that." Marcus: "You're FBI. You're here to arrest me." Bex: "I went rogue. No backup, no handler. I'm here to save you." He doesn't know whether to believe her, hate her, trust her. "Why should I trust anything you say?" She: "Because I'm destroying my career, my identity, everything—to give you this choice. Stop the bombing. We expose Karl together." Clock ticking: 48 hours to detonation.

## ACT 3: CONFRONTATION & RESOLUTION (Chapters 23-30)

Marcus processes betrayal and decides to work with Bex to expose Karl, they plan sabotage operation, confront Karl and hardliner faction, FBI raid occurs, bombing is prevented, aftermath leaves Marcus arrested and Bex psychologically destroyed.

### Chapter 23: Uneasy Alliance

Marcus and Bex in park for hours. He's processing: Willow is Bex, Karl is KGB, his revolution is Soviet operation, the woman he loved (loves?) destroyed him to save him. Asks why she left in 1968. She explains: breakdown from violence and drugs, couldn't watch friends die, ran to survive. He never knew she was that damaged—thought she just abandoned him. Grief and understanding mixing with betrayal. He studies Soviet evidence again, realizes it's authentic. Karl HAS been manipulating him—every tactical decision pushed toward greater violence, civilian casualties, propaganda value. Feels like fool, puppet, useful idiot. Asks Bex: "What happens now?" She: "We stop the bombing together. Expose Karl, dismantle devices, save lives." He: "Then I get arrested." She: "Probably. But you won't be terrorist—you'll be the man who stopped one." He agrees: "I'll help. Not for you. For the people who'd die." Alliance formed on broken trust.

**Word count: 150**

### Chapter 24: Planning the Sabotage

They need to: identify Karl's loyalists vs. Marcus's true followers, locate both bombs (recruitment center and BART backup), disable devices, and neutralize Karl before he triggers manual detonation. Timeline: 36 hours. Bex has technical training from PROJECT MIRROR, Marcus knows the network. Strategy: Marcus calls collective meeting, announces he's canceling bombing (discovered Karl is Soviet infiltrator), forces Karl to reveal himself and his faction. Risky—Karl might trigger devices early, might kill them both, might escape. But it's the play. Bex suggests contacting FBI for support. Marcus refuses: "I'm not working with feds. You already betrayed me once—this is my operation, my people, my mess to clean." She accepts. They plan speech Marcus will give: exposing Soviet manipulation, calling for real revolution vs. terrorism. Bex will watch for Karl's response, identify loyalists. It's desperate plan. Might work. Probably won't. 36 hours until detonation.

**Word count: 150**

### Chapter 25: The Meeting

Safe house, full collective. Marcus calls emergency session. Everyone present: Sunny, Rita Walsh, David Park, Karl, others. Tension immediate—Karl senses something wrong. Marcus stands, begins speech: "We need to talk about what revolution actually means. I've been manipulated. We've been used." Explains Karl is KGB officer, shows evidence (photographs Bex took), reveals Soviet operation using American radicals as pawns. Collective shocked. Karl stays calm: "This is FBI disinformation. Marcus has been compromised." Points at Bex/Willow: "She's the infiltrator. I've suspected for weeks. She's FBI operative, probably CIA." Bex freezes—he knows. Karl: "Real name's Rebecca Morrison, PROJECT MIRROR deep-cover specialist. Check her background—all fake." Collective turns on Bex. Sunny looks betrayed, Rita vindicated, David calculating. Marcus steps between: "She told me herself. Came clean to expose you, Karl. Question is: who do we believe?"

**Word count: 149**

### Chapter 26: The Split

Collective fractures. Some believe Marcus (Sunny stays loyal, few others). Others believe Karl (Rita sides with him—trusts Soviet support over FBI infiltrator, David Park stays with whoever controls the bombs). Karl's faction is hardliners: committed to violence regardless of Soviet manipulation, willing to kill for revolution. Marcus's faction is idealists: wanted symbolic action, not mass murder. Karl makes his move: "Bombing proceeds. We have 30 hours. Anyone who opposes is counterrevolutionary." Pulls gun. His loyalists armed too. Standoff in safe house. Marcus: "You'll kill civilians for propaganda. That's not revolution—that's terrorism." Karl: "It's necessary. You're too weak. I'm taking operational control." Moves to leave with his faction and David (the bomb-maker). Marcus and Bex can't stop them—outnumbered, outgunned. Karl's team exits to finalize bombing. Marcus's group remains: shocked, fractured, leaderless. Sunny crying, others confused. Bex: "We have 30 hours to stop them."

**Word count: 149**

### Chapter 27: Desperate Measures

Bex breaks her rogue status: calls Garrett from pay phone. "This is Morrison. I know I'm burned, but Karl Brenner is KGB handler, has bombs at two locations, 30-hour timeline. Need immediate FBI response." Garrett: "You went dark for four days. We've been planning raid anyway based on your last intel. Teams are mobilizing." Relief—backup exists. But Garrett: "You're burned asset, Morrison. When this goes down, you're done. Career over, possibly prosecution for going rogue." She: "I know. Just stop the bombing." Gives him locations, Karl's faction details, everything. Meanwhile, Marcus rallies his remaining followers: "We're going to those bomb sites, convincing Karl's people to stand down, or disabling devices ourselves." Bex: "FBI is coming." Marcus: "Then we better move fast." Two operations converging: FBI raid and civilian sabotage. 30 hours until detonation. Bex and Marcus working together one last time.

**Word count: 150**

### Chapter 28: Oakland Recruitment Center

Marcus, Bex, Sunny, and two other loyalists reach recruitment center. Karl's team already there—David Park working on bomb in basement, Karl and two hardliners providing security. Bex and Marcus approach: "David, don't do this. Karl is using you for Soviet operation. Those casualties will be children, workers, innocents." David: "I know. Don't care. System requires dismantling." Cold technician, not ideologue. Karl appears: "You should have stayed away, Marcus. This is bigger than you now." Marcus tries reaching him human-to-human: "We wanted justice, not murder." Karl: "I never wanted justice. I wanted American blood for Soviet advantage. You were always the useful idiot." Pulls gun on Marcus. Bex moves—tackles Karl, training activating. Fight breaks out: Karl vs. Bex, Marcus vs. hardliners, Sunny trying to reach David at bomb. Chaos in basement, timer ticking, 6 hours until detonation. FBI sirens approaching outside.

**Word count: 148**

### Chapter 29: The Raid

FBI storms building. Garrett leading team, full tactical gear. Sees Bex fighting Karl, Marcus subduing hardliner, Sunny at bomb (doesn't know how to disarm it, just pulled wires—might trigger it). Garrett: "Everyone down! Federal agents!" Karl uses chaos to grab detonator—manual trigger for backup plan. "If I can't have Oakland, BART station goes now!" Tries to transmit signal. Bex lunges, knocks detonator from his hand. Karl pulls knife, comes at her. Garrett shoots Karl—center mass, professional. Karl drops. Dead before hitting ground. Soviet operation ended. David Park surrenders, hands up. Marcus and his followers surrounded by FBI. Bomb squad disarms Oakland device—6 hours remained. Radio confirms BART device also secured (simultaneous raid based on Bex's intelligence). Bombing prevented, network destroyed, zero casualties. Total success. Garrett cuffs Marcus personally: "Marcus Webb, you're under federal arrest." Marcus looks at Bex: "Was any of it real?" She doesn't answer. Doesn't know.

**Word count: 150**

### Chapter 30: Fracture

FBI debrief room, three days later. Bex sitting across from Garrett. Mission report: bombing prevented, Soviet active measures operation exposed, KGB officer eliminated, radical network dismantled. Perfect operational success. Garrett: "You went rogue, violated protocols, nearly destroyed the mission." Bex: "But it worked." Garrett: "This time. You're psychologically compromised. PROJECT MIRROR assessment recommends psychiatric evaluation, indefinite operational suspension." She knew this was coming. "I quit anyway." Gives him her resignation—can't be operative anymore, doesn't know who Bex Morrison is, needs to find herself before she's gone completely. Garrett: "I'm sorry. We shouldn't have sent you back there." Rare admission of guilt. She leaves FBI, returns to San Francisco. Stands outside old safe house (now crime scene), remembers 1967 idealism, 1975 betrayal. Marcus is in federal prison awaiting trial. Sent her one letter: "I don't forgive you. But I understand." Final scene: Bex in her apartment, looking at mirror, trying different expressions. Testing which one feels like her. None of them do. She's 29, saved lives, destroyed herself. Some victories are annihilations. Survivor's guilt completes its circle: she survived the 60s by leaving, survived the 70s by destroying what remained. Rebecca Morrison doesn't exist anymore. Just accumulated performances with no core. She won. She's gone.
